##Descriptive statistics calculation##
class
#Specifing a variable using $ sign
class$heights
# specifying a value in a variable
class$heights[3]

##Calculating mean, median and mode
# First way to calculate the mean is: (68 + 63 + 71 + 72) / 4
# Second way. Use dollar sign notation and bracket notation so that we don't # have to type individual heights
(class$heights[1] + class$heights[2] + class$heights[3] + class$heights[4]) / 4
#Third way, mean fucntion and use dollar sign
mean(class$heights)
mode(class$heights)
median(class$heights)

##Calculating summary
# First way to calculate the mean,(68 + 63 + 71 + 72) / 4
# Second way. Use dollar sign notation and bracket notation so that we don't,have to type individual heights
(class$heights[1] + class$heights[2] + class$heights[3] + class$heights[4]) / 4
# Third way. Use dollar sign notation 
sum(class$heights)
# Fourth is mean and sum function so that we don't have to type as much
sum(class$heights) / 4
sum(dys_severity)

##Nesting functions##
# Writing the division operator as a function with parentheses
# Because the division operator isnâ€™t a letter, we had to wrap it in backticks (`)
`/`(8, 4)
# secondly, one function is nested inside another function.
`/`(sum(class$heights), 4)

##The length function##
length(class$heights)
length(dys_severity)

#Both length and height functions#
sum(class$heights) / length(class$heights)

##Exercise## Use this version always
# create a new variable and add it to the class data frame
weights <- c(160, 170, 180, 190)
class$weight <- c(160, 170, 180, 190)
class
mean(class$weight)
dys_class$weight <- c(50, 70,38,42)
dys_class
mean(dys_class$weight)

##Differences of objects and columns##
#variables/columns are in a data frame and uses $ to specify it
#objects are stored as vectors in the environment
